## 📌 Project Overview
We will be starting a new series where I'll create the Contacts App. The project is quite extensive and will take around six videos to complete.

We will cover four major advanced topics:
- **MVVM**
- **Room Database**
- **Coroutines**
- **Navigation Component**

This project is built using **Jetpack Compose**. I highly recommend revising each topic before starting.
